# Discovering Conservation Laws using Optimal Transport and Manifold Learning

This is an implementation of our method for discovering conservation laws directly from trajectory samples. We reformulate this task as a manifold learning problem and propose a non-parametric approach, combining the Wasserstein metric from optimal transport with diffusion maps, to discover conserved quantities that vary across trajectories sampled from a dynamical system. The Wasserstein distances are efficiently computed using the Sinkhorn algorithm implemented by the OTT-JAX library, and the diffusion maps are implemented using NumPy/SciPy.
